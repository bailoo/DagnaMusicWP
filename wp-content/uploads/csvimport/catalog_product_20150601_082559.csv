Crystal nylon for the high notes and silver plated copper with antioxidant protection on the multifilament nylon for the low notes. The perfect string for concerts <br \>

Galli Genius nylon strings are carefully formulated using a new clear nylon compound. The musical results are superior volume, warmth, clarity and intonation over other traditional nylon strings - rounder focused trebles, deeper richer basses - concert strings applauded by discriminating professionals for their outstanding beauty and refinement of sound. <br \>

The Genius nylon treble strings are clear, musical and have great projection. The third string is bright and focused, not tubby or weak. The basses possess a depth and richness that compliment cedar and spruce top guitars equally well. They are also less prone to noisy left hand shift squeaks. Overall, the entire set responds unusually fast to expressive changes in color and articulation. And once in tune, these strings stay in tune very well. Galli Genius Nylon treble sets come with bass sets featuring Galli's unique Pro-Coated polymer process, further assuring superior quality and richness of sound. <br \>

The engineers at Elixir took their original Polyweb coating and shrunk it down to Nanoweb size. The result? Brighter-sounding electric guitar strings that last 3 to 5 times longer than regular strings. <br \>

In addition to an ultrathin grunge-resistant tubular coating on the wound strings, Nanowebs now have a revolutionary Anti-Rust plating on the plain strings to extend their life too. <br \>

Elixirs are the first major innovation in guitar strings in over forty years, and they deliver what they promise: great tone and long life no matter what you put them on or how often you play. <br \>

And the AJ-220S is made with Epiphone’s century’s worth of experience in crafting world-class guitars that are meant to be played.

Acoustic guitar players know it’s difficult to find an instrument that has both a deep bass tone and crisp loud projection. On a small stage with an acoustic band and little amplification, a good acoustic guitar should be able be heard and anchor a band. The AJ220S’s strong and balanced tone will make other acoustic players who have spent much more on their guitars wish they had gone to Epiphone instead. Like all our Epiphone acoustics, the AJ220S is legendary for being easy to set up and for staying in tune so no matter how much playing time you have, it's ready to go.

PR-4E,,Default,simple,"Acoustic Guitar","Default Category",base,,,,"2014-07-07 06:26:51",,,,,"The PR-4E features a select Spruce top. The ‘top’ of any acoustic guitar is the source of its “voice” and acts as a kind of soundboard. Spruce is one of the preferred tonewoods when making acoustic guitars for its ability to hold up to hours of playing time in all kinds of venues and still project a rich tone. The PR-4E’s select Spruce top is supported by vintage style X-bracing—just like vintage Epiphone Masterbilts--which not only supports the top but also gives the PR-4E considerable volume and balance for its size. It’s a perfect guitar for singer-songwriters too, and thanks to the quality construction and combination of Spruce and Mahogany, the PR-4E doesn’t suffer from sounding “boomy” or “scooped” like other beginner’s guitars.  The Venetian cutaway allows easy reach to the upper frets and gives the PR-4E a distinctive profile that’s both modern and classic.
 
The PR-4E’s Mahogany body features 5-layer white and black binding and the Mahogany neck has a Rosewood fingerboard, a 1.68” nut, and single layer white binding along the neck.  There are premium die-cast 14:1 ratio machine heads (tuners) on the Epiphone trademark Sloped Dovewing headstock along with a classic 60s era Epiphone logo.

AC1-RhythmVOX,,Default,simple,Accessories,"Default Category",base,,,,"2014-07-07 08:30:01",,,,,"Key Features <br \>
• The AC1 battery-powered VOX mini amp; supercharged with rhythm patterns – and more <br \>
• Includes a total of 66 built-in Rhythm/Song Patterns <br \>
• One extended length additional song pattern <br \>
• Analog circuitry borrowed from the acclaimed amPlug series <br \>
• OVERDRIVE switch provides more sonic variation <br \>
• AUX IN jack for jamming along to your favorite tunes using your CD/MP3 player <br \>

Ultra-small mini amps have gained great popularity as “first amps” or ""practice amps."" Their highly cost-effective price allows them to be purchased casually as an accessory. The convenience of battery power and their space-saving ease of use only add to their appeal. Many professional guitarists like these amps for warming up in the dressing room. The casual guitarist may enjoy keeping a mini amp in the office, in the bedroom, or may carry one for inspired performing at any time. With the VOX AC1 already a member of the VOX lineup, the new AC1 RhythmVOX adds a wealth of features never before seen on a mini amp – until now! In particular, the rhythm function rivals that of dedicated units, providing a total of 66 Rhythm/Song Patterns. The AC1 RhythmVOX is a great choice not only as a first amp, but also as a warm-up amp on the road or in your rehearsal space, for practicing using the patterns as a metronome, or even as a rhythm box. It's sure to have a long and warm relationship with any guitarist. <br \>

Powerful Rhythm Features <br \>
As its name suggests, the AC1 RhythmVOX is a guitar amp that includes some cool rhythm features. The ten Rhythm Patterns include not just standards such as 8 beat, 16 beat, and blues; but also funk, reggae, and even complex irregular patterns. There's also one song pattern containing an extended, multi-measure drum part. In addition, each Rhythm Pattern and Song Pattern provides six types of variation, for a total of 66 rhythm variations. Each of them boasts serious sound quality with excellent presence, allowing you to perform with a realistic drum backing. The tempo and volume of each rhythm pattern can be intuitively controlled, and you can quickly recall the rhythm pattern you want. The “Rhythm” section of the AC1 RhythmVOX is both as a guide to help you keep the beat, and as a way to work out your original ideas and riffs. You can also use it as a rhythm trainer for practicing, and as accompaniment that you can enjoy jamming along with. Simply adding backing patterns will double your guitar playing enjoyment. <br \>

Enhanced Amp Performance <br \>
The AC1 RhythmVOX also has a lot to offer as a guitar amp. To begin with, there’s a full complement of gain, tone, and volume controls, letting you dial-in a broad range of sounds to suite your taste. A pair of three-inch speakers delivers a full-bodied sound. Refinements have been made to deliver even more highly developed realistic and full-fledged amp sound, based on the analog circuitry developed for the best-selling amPlug series of headphone amps. Best of all, we’ve added an OVERDRIVE switch to provide more sonic variation. Switch it on for a serious high-gain sound; switch it off for a bright, clean sound. <br \>",No,,,,,0,/b/u/buy_vox_amplifier_ac1_rhythm_vox_bass_india_2.jpg,,,,"Buy AC1 Rhythm VOX Mini Guitar Amplifier with Rhythm.
